# AWS FARGATE
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers on AWS, providing the following key features:

1. **Container Orchestration:** Fargate abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus solely on deploying and managing containers.

2. **Serverless Compute:** Users pay only for the resources consumed by their containers, without needing to provision or manage servers.

3. **Elastic Scaling:** Fargate automatically scales containers based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

4. **Integration with ECS and EKS:** Fargate seamlessly integrates with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), enabling easy deployment of containerized applications.

5. **Security and Isolation:** Fargate provides strong security isolation between containers, with built-in support for IAM roles, networking, and encryption.
